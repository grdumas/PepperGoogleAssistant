Integrating Pepper Robot and Google Assistant


The Pepper Robot was developed by SoftBank Robotics to be a more social robot that could effectively interact with people. The platform holds immense promise in commercial and educational applications, but Pepper’s default configuration imposes limits on its usefulness - by default Pepper can only converse in English and Japanese, and even in those two supported languages the robot’s capacity for conversation is rudimentary. Contemporary “smart” assistant technologies such as Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Google Assistant, and Samsung Bibxy offer the possibility of much richer conversation and in a wider offering of languages, but are not readily available for use with Pepper. Software development kits (SDKs) provide one potential way to connect “smart” assistants with the Pepper robot platform. Using the Pepper SDK and Google Assistant SDK we intend to prototype one such implementation. This method could serve both as a means to overcome the Pepper’s limited conversation and language capabilities, and also might be further extended to bring additional “smart” functionality to the Pepper.
