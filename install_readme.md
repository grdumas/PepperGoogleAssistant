# Installation and Setup

## Development Environment
### Operating System (OS)
This project was developed on a workstation running [Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus](https://ubuntu.com/16-04) in the interest of compatibility with SoftBank software. To download, please see the [ubuntu releases website](https://releases.ubuntu.com/). The documentation which follows covers use on Ubuntu 16.04. At this time, functionality on later Ubuntu releases, other Linux distributions, Windows, and Mac systems is untested. If using another operating system, please adjust instructions referencing various utilities found on the Ubuntu distribution, such as the [apt package manager](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/package-management), to work with your environment.
